# Financial Analytics Pipeline on Databricks

[![Tests](https://github.com/madhurima-nath/databricks-ai-automated-pipeline/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madhurima-nath/databricks-ai-automated-pipeline/actions/workflows/test.yml)

An end-to-end data engineering project on Databricks: a medallion architecture pipeline on 15 years
of US and European market data, and a SAS → PySpark converter that automates legacy code migration.

**Pipeline:** Ingests S&P 500, Euro Stoxx 50, VIX, US Federal Funds Rate, and ECB Deposit Facility
Rate through Bronze, Silver, and Gold Delta Lake layers. The Gold layer computes rolling volatility,
US–EU equity correlations, central bank policy divergence, and drawdown — the analytics that SAS
risk teams run today, now running in PySpark on real data.

**Migration tool:** A SAS → PySpark converter that translates legacy SAS code (PROC SORT,
PROC MEANS, PROC SQL, DATA steps) to PySpark DataFrame API or Databricks SQL. Common patterns
are handled by a deterministic rule engine; anything outside those patterns falls back to Claude
(claude-haiku-4-5) via the Anthropic API.

**Built with Claude Code** as a development collaborator — for architecture decisions, the quality
checks module, and the converter's rule engine. The converter deploys the same AI capability as a
production feature: rule engine for recognised patterns, Claude AI fallback for the rest.

## Key technical details

### The Silver layer join

The Fed Funds Rate and ECB rate are monthly; equity data is daily. A standard join leaves most
rows null. Silver resolves this with a forward-fill window function:

```python
fill_window = Window.orderBy("date").rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)
df = df.withColumn(
    "fed_rate",
    F.last(F.col("fed_rate"), ignorenulls=True).over(fill_window)
)
```

Each trading day carries the most recently observed rate — a point-in-time join that avoids
lookahead bias.

### Data quality layer

Quality checks run at Bronze → Silver and Silver → Gold transitions. The `00_quality_checks`
module is domain-agnostic and reusable across projects:

```python
run_quality_checks(
    df, "bronze_sp500",
    min_rows=3000,
    null_cols=["close"],
    range_checks={"close": (100, 10000)},
    check_duplicates_on=["date"],
)
```

Each check logs PASS or FAIL with detail. A FAIL raises immediately to halt the pipeline.

### Gold layer metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sp500_vol_20d / 60d` | Rolling realised volatility, annualised (std of log returns × √252) |
| `eurostoxx_vol_20d / 60d` | Same for Euro Stoxx 50 |
| `us_eu_equity_corr_60d` | 60-day rolling Pearson correlation between US and EU equity returns |
| `sp500_vix_corr_60d` | 60-day correlation between S&P 500 return and VIX (typically strongly negative) |
| `sp500_drawdown_52w` | % drawdown from 52-week rolling high |
| `us_rate_regime` | `low` / `medium` / `high` based on Fed Funds Rate |
| `eu_rate_regime` | `negative` / `low` / `medium` / `high` based on ECB rate |
| `policy_divergence` | `us_significantly_higher` / `us_higher` / `aligned` / `eu_higher` |
| `vix_regime` | `calm` (<20) / `elevated` (20–30) / `stress` (≥30) |

### SAS → PySpark converter

Handles: `PROC SORT`, `PROC MEANS`, `PROC SQL`, `DATA` steps with `KEEP`, `DROP`, `RENAME`,
`WHERE`, `IF-THEN-ELSE`, `RETAIN` (with warning), date functions (`TODAY()`, `MDY()`),
`INTCK` (with warning), and SAS macro variables.

```python
from src.converter.sas_to_pyspark import convert

result = convert("""
PROC SORT DATA=customers;
    BY region last_name;
RUN;
""", target="pyspark")

print(result.output)
# customers_df = customers_df.orderBy("region", "last_name")

print(result.notes)
# ['PROC SORT → .orderBy()']
```

Tested with 30 pytest cases: 23 covering every supported SAS construct (sort, aggregation, SQL, DATA step variants, date functions, and warning cases for constructs like RETAIN and INTCK), and 7 covering the pipeline submission script (credential loading, exit codes, job status handling). The full suite runs automatically on every push to main via GitHub Actions. Pipeline notebook execution is validated on Databricks through quality checks at every layer transition.

## Community Edition constraints

This project runs on Databricks Community Edition. Compared to a full workspace:

| Feature | Community Edition | Premium |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Delta Lake | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hive Metastore | ✅ | ✅ |
| Unity Catalog | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delta Live Tables | ❌ | ✅ |
| Databricks Apps | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-task Jobs API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cluster auto-scaling | ❌ | ✅ |

Code is written to be Unity Catalog-ready — adding catalog prefixes (`trading.bronze.sp500`)
is the only change required when migrating to a full workspace.

## Setup

### Local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhurima-nath/databricks-ai-automated-pipeline
cd databricks-ai-automated-pipeline
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key      # optional — needed for complex SAS patterns
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.azuredatabricks.net
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
DATABRICKS_JOB_ID=12345                   # set after registering the job below
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Databricks

**First time:**

1. Go to **Repos → Add Repo** and enter this repository URL.
2. Open `notebooks/01_bronze_ingest.py`. A **FRED API Key** widget appears at the top —
   paste your key there before running. The key is never saved to a file or committed to git.
3. Register the pipeline job:
   ```bash
   databricks jobs create --json @jobs/pipeline_job.json
   ```
   Note the returned job ID and add it to `.env` as `DATABRICKS_JOB_ID`.

**Subsequent runs:**

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --job-id 12345
```

The pipeline fetches from Yahoo Finance and FRED on every run — all five series are updated through the current date automatically. Re-run at any time to pull the latest data.

The Streamlit dashboard is at [financial-analytics-databricks.streamlit.app](https://financial-analytics-databricks.streamlit.app).
