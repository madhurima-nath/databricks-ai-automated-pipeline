# Financial Analytics Pipeline on Databricks


An end-to-end data engineering project on Databricks: a medallion architecture pipeline on 15 years
of US and European market data, and a SAS → PySpark converter that automates legacy code migration.

**Pipeline:** Ingests S&P 500, Euro Stoxx 50, VIX, US Federal Funds Rate, and ECB Deposit Facility
Rate through Bronze, Silver, and Gold Delta Lake layers. The Gold layer is the consumption-ready
layer where final business rules and aggregations are applied: rolling volatility, US-EU equity
correlations, central bank policy divergence, % decline from peak, and regime classifications on 15 years of
real market data.

**Migration tool:** A SAS → PySpark converter that translates legacy SAS code (PROC SORT,
PROC MEANS, PROC SQL, DATA steps) to PySpark DataFrame API or Databricks SQL. Two modes:
Community (convert a single SAS block) and Enterprise (convert a full script using a config
file that maps SAS library names and variables to Databricks paths). Common patterns are
handled by a deterministic rule engine; anything else falls back to Claude AI.

**Built with Claude Code** as a development collaborator — for architecture decisions, the quality
checks module, and the converter's rule engine.

## Key technical details

### What the medallion architecture makes explicit

In a SAS script, ingestion, cleaning, joining, and business logic typically share one file. A
change to any part reruns everything; there is no clean boundary between what was ingested and
what was computed.

The medallion architecture separates each step. Bronze preserves source data exactly as received.
Silver owns data preparation — including the forward-fill join that aligns monthly interest rates
onto the daily trading sequence. Gold applies business rules on top of the prepared data. Each
layer is independently testable; a change to Gold does not touch Silver.

### Bronze layer

Five Delta tables written without any transforms — source data preserved exactly as received:
`bronze_sp500`, `bronze_eurostoxx`, `bronze_vix` from Yahoo Finance (daily OHLCV), and
`bronze_fed_rate`, `bronze_ecb_rate` from FRED (monthly rates). Because Bronze never transforms,
the full history can be re-derived by rerunning Silver against Bronze if any cleaning rule changes —
without calling the original APIs again.

### Data quality layer

Quality checks run at Bronze → Silver and Silver → Gold transitions. The `00_quality_checks`
module is domain-agnostic and reusable across projects:

```python
run_quality_checks(
    df, "bronze_sp500",
    min_rows=3000,
    null_cols=["close"],
    range_checks={"close": (100, 10000)},
    check_duplicates_on=["date"],
)
```

Each check logs PASS or FAIL with detail. A FAIL raises immediately to halt the pipeline.

### Gold layer metrics

In the Databricks medallion architecture, the Gold layer is the consumption-ready layer where
final business rules and aggregations are applied for specific use cases. A financial analyst
opening the dashboard gets rolling volatility, correlations, rate regimes, and price decline from
peak as direct answers, with no further calculation needed.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sp500_vol_20d / 60d` | Rolling realised volatility, annualised (std of log returns × √252) |
| `eurostoxx_vol_20d / 60d` | Same for Euro Stoxx 50 |
| `us_eu_equity_corr_60d` | 60-day rolling Pearson correlation between US and EU equity returns |
| `sp500_vix_corr_60d` | 60-day correlation between S&P 500 return and VIX (typically strongly negative) |
| `sp500_drawdown_52w` | % drawdown from 52-week rolling high |
| `us_rate_regime` | `low` / `medium` / `high` based on Fed Funds Rate |
| `eu_rate_regime` | `negative` / `low` / `medium` / `high` based on ECB rate |
| `policy_divergence` | `us_significantly_higher` / `us_higher` / `aligned` / `eu_higher` |
| `vix_regime` | `calm` (<20) / `elevated` (20–30) / `stress` (≥30) |

### SAS → PySpark converter

Handles: `PROC SORT`, `PROC MEANS`, `PROC SQL`, `DATA` steps with `KEEP`, `DROP`, `RENAME`,
`WHERE`, `IF-THEN-ELSE`, `RETAIN` (with warning), date functions (`TODAY()`, `MDY()`),
`INTCK` (with warning), and SAS macro variables.

```python
from src.converter.sas_to_pyspark import convert

result = convert("""
PROC SORT DATA=customers;
    BY region last_name;
RUN;
""", target="pyspark")

print(result.output)
# customers_df = customers_df.orderBy("region", "last_name")

print(result.notes)
# ['PROC SORT → .orderBy()']
```

**Enterprise mode** converts a full SAS script using a config file that maps SAS library names
and variables to Databricks table paths:

```python
from src.converter import convert_script, load_config_from_dict, generate_manifest

config = load_config_from_dict({
    "source": {
        "library_mappings": {"risklib": "trading.bronze"},
        "macro_vars": {"start_date": "2010-01-01"},
    },
    "target": {"platform": "enterprise", "unity_catalog": False},
})

results = convert_script(sas_script, config=config)
manifest_yaml = generate_manifest(results, source_label="risk_models.sas")
```

`generate_manifest()` produces a YAML summary of each block — how it was converted, its
confidence score, and anything that needs a manual check.

Tested with 46 pytest cases: 39 covering the SAS converter (all supported patterns, Community and Enterprise modes) and 7 covering the pipeline script (credential loading, exit codes, job status handling). Pipeline notebook execution is validated on Databricks through quality checks at every layer transition.

## Community Edition constraints

This project runs on Databricks Community Edition. Compared to a full workspace:

| Feature | Community Edition | Premium |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Delta Lake | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hive Metastore | ✅ | ✅ |
| Unity Catalog | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delta Live Tables | ❌ | ✅ |
| Databricks Apps | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-task Jobs API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cluster auto-scaling | ❌ | ✅ |

Code is written to be Unity Catalog-ready — adding catalog prefixes (`trading.bronze.sp500`)
is the only change required when migrating to a full workspace.

## Setup

### Local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhurima-nath/databricks-ai-automated-pipeline
cd databricks-ai-automated-pipeline
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key      # optional — needed for complex SAS patterns
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.azuredatabricks.net
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
DATABRICKS_JOB_ID=12345                   # set after registering the job below
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Databricks

**First time:**

1. Go to **Repos → Add Repo** and enter this repository URL.
2. Open `notebooks/01_bronze_ingest.py`. A **FRED API Key** widget appears at the top —
   paste your key there before running. The key is never saved to a file or committed to git.
3. Register the pipeline job:
   ```bash
   databricks jobs create --json @jobs/pipeline_job.json
   ```
   Note the returned job ID and add it to `.env` as `DATABRICKS_JOB_ID`.

**Subsequent runs:**

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --job-id 12345
```

The pipeline fetches from Yahoo Finance and FRED on every run — all five series are updated through the current date automatically. Re-run at any time to pull the latest data.

The Streamlit dashboard is at [Live Streamlit dashboard](https://financial-analytics-databricks.streamlit.app).
